[Binder] turns this GitHub repository into a collection of interactive notebooks.

Each Binder session starts with a new copy of the files in repository: 
you cannot break anything. 
But all your changes are lost when you close your browser. 
**You must download your notebooks to save your work:**
in the `File` menu select `Download as / Notebook (.ipynb)`.
